        <h2> A site sending out an S.O.S.</h2>
        <p>The original site for S.O.S. Humanitarian Actions is undeniably in desperate need of a redesign. The intention of the organization is to provide help to those in need in both Africa and the greater Atlanta area. However, the site hinders this mission through its confusing layout, a barrage of pixelated images, and suspicious donation links. One user summed it up well when they said the site made them want to run away.</p>
        <p>Our focus in the site design will be to make the site more trustworthy and and pleasant for users who want to learn more about and donate to the organization. This will be accomplished by reorganizing the data within the site, by rebranding the site with more pleasing and comforting logos, colors, and images. Lastly, we will build new forms and donation links in order to promote increased donations and volunteer opportunities.</p>

        <h2> Research and Ideation</h2>
        <p>  We began our research by redlining the site. This gave us a well-rounded understanding of what the site needed and what the site already had to offer. From there,  we developed a proto-persona to base our assumptions on, focusing on a user from the Atlanta area that would want to donate to the organization. </p>
         <p> However, this was not enough. Next, we conducted user interviews of the original site in order to ascertain that our own observations were correct. We tested 5 users, and created an Affinity Diagram from the results of their testing. The results were clear, the site was horrible and a prime candidate for a redesign.</p>

        <p> Style Guide

          Meanwhile, I designed the style tile and style guide for the site. Much of my design inspiration came from the flag of the country of Togo, one of the primary places that S.O.S for Humanitarian Actions serves in. Also, since many of the images from the organization were too pixelated, we chose the majority of the new site images from Unsplash. We agreed as a group that the site should rely heavily on white space and minimal design, in stark contrast to the original site.

        <p> Lo/Mid and Hi Fidelity Prototyping

          As a group, we agreed to skip low fidelity sketching and lo fidelity wire-framing,  and instead moved directly into mid fidelity wire-framing. This was due in part to our team being under strict time constraints from the class schedule, as well as a general consensus that we knew exactly what the redesigned site should look like. My team members focused on creating the desktop prototypes, while I worked on the mobile prototypes.</p>

     <p> Testing

      Between each level of prototype fidelity we conducted user task testing with 3-5 users in order to determine any problems with our prototypes. At the mid-fi level, we saw an overall satisfaction with the new site, however most users requested a new donation form rather than a donation link, as well as a volunteer form and updated menu terms. We applied this data and created a mid-fi version 2.
      
      At this point we were already approaching hi fidelity with our prototyping, so we began to apply the style guide and update imagery for the site. Once again, conducted user testing, which was greatly encouraging and only revealed a few minor issues that we soon corrected.</p>

      <h2> Conclusion </h2>
      <p> 
        As a team, we were in awe of the transformation that we were able to accomplish in a few short weeks. What began as a suspicious, confusing site is now a prototype that gives the impression of trustworthiness and openness. The next step for our site redesign would be to present it to S.O.S for Humanitarian Actions and work with them directly to further improve the site to fit their growing and diverse needs.</p>
